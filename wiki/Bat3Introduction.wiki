This bat3 project started after having issues with the original software for the 
TS-BAT3 board which can be found here: ftp://ftp.embeddedarm.com/bat3/bat3src.tar.gz.

_Ideas_:
  * using *syslog*
  * help on use
  * using tcp/ip

= Goal =

With this project, I'm also trying to get used using the autotools, more about 
it on the AutoToolsNotes.  Meanwhile, I can get used using the google code pages.
