Bat3 aims to be an enhanced version of the ts-bat3 controlling software.  There's a real download available (v.0.1.3) or you could try the svn version.  There are some notes about it on [my quick ts-embeddedarm page](http://users.pandora.be/tisnix/ts-7260/).  [The post about this release](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ts-7000/message/11556) can be found in the ts-yahoo group.

If you have any comments, feel free to post them on the [bat3 google group](http://groups.google.com/group/bat3-discuss).  I even try to follow the yahoo group.

There are some interesting discussions in the mailing list:
  * [TS-7260 with TS-BAT3: waking up after extended sleep](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ts-7000/message/5455)
  * [Rewriting the BAT3 soft: API available?](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ts-7000/message/6104)

There should be some documentation about bat3 on Bat3Documentation
